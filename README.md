The primary objective of this project is to enhance security measures by implementing a user authentication system. The system utilizes image comparison techniques to verify the user's identity by comparing their provided image with the backend reference image. Once the user's identity is successfully authenticated, they will be granted access to enter the meeting. This security measure ensures that only authorized individuals can participate in the meeting, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and promoting a secure environment for all attendees.
